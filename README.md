# Advanced-Lane-Finding
Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Class Project, due on Feb 13th, 2017



The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Camera Calibration

####1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

Any camera lens will have distortion problem as showing. I intent to use gopro camera for some future work, so I would like to use my own picture to give a try.

</p>
The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./Advanced-Lane_Finging.ipynb".
I am using opencv method. The key idea is using a knowing object, take many pictures from the camera and lens that you want to calibrate. You define the point location, you also need find point location in the picture space. Because of the lens distortion, the points location will not match at this point. Also do this manually is very time consuming and lead to error as well. OpenCV have automatic tools can help. I downloaded a 10x7 black and white chessboard from Udacity class for this task. I printed on 11x17 paper and put on flat surface. The chessboard has 9x6 inner corners. The black and white contrast make it easy and reliable detected by opencv. For the code, I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard inner corners in the world. Here is 9x6, counted by hand. For this project, I am using a flat surface, the z will be always = 0.  Thus, for each test image iteration, the detected corner (x,y) pixel location will be appended to `imgpoint`, and knowning `objp` will be appended into `objpoint`. The process needs 20 - 30 images from different angles and distances to cover the protential usage of the camera. 

Then I can use the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

###Pipeline (single images)

####1. Apply distortion-correction to raw image.
To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.
I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image. 
I defined each transform and methods as a function, so I can call them later in the pipeline. 
```
def abs_sobel_thresh(img, orient='x', sobel_kernel=3, thresh=(0,255)):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Apply x or y gradient with the OpenCV Sobel() function
    # and take the absolute value
    if orient == 'x':
        abs_sobel = np.absolute(cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0))
    if orient == 'y':
        abs_sobel = np.absolute(cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1))
    # Rescale back to 8 bit integer
    scaled_sobel = np.uint8(255*abs_sobel/np.max(abs_sobel))
    # Create a copy and apply the threshold
    binary_output = np.zeros_like(scaled_sobel)
    # Here I'm using inclusive (>=, <=) thresholds, but exclusive is ok too
    binary_output[(scaled_sobel >= thresh[0]) & (scaled_sobel <= thresh[1])] = 1

    # Return the result
    return binary_output
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="./output_images/Thresholded_y_Gradient.png" width="720">
</p>

(thresholding steps at lines # through # in `another_file.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])

```
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

####4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

---

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
